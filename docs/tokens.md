## Design tokens are the atoms of the system as [Salesforce describes them](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/).

### In Swayable Design System we rely on a [custom Tailwindcss theme](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme) for our design tokens, and strongly prefer Tailwindcss classes over custom CSS. This makes our design consistent and easily maintained across our systems

##### Tailwindcss offer many classes which [you can find here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs). However are just a few for quick reference.
- [Padding](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/padding)
- [Margin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/margin)
- [Flex](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/flex)
