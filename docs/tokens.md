These are the basic components from which all else springs.

## [Inter Typeface](https://rsms.me/inter/)

Inter is a typeface by [Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me/inter/). It is beautiful, functional, and chock full of features. It's also the standard typeface used in [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/documentation#optional-add-the-inter-font-family) which has aided in developing our component library.

> Inter is a typeface carefully crafted & designed for computer screens.
> Inter features a tall x-height to aid in readability of mixed-case and lower-case text. Several OpenType features are provided as well, like contextual alternates that adjusts punctuation depending on the shape of surrounding glyphs, slashed zero for when you need to disambiguate "0" from "o", tabular numbers, etc.
