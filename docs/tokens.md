## Design tokens are the atoms of the system as [Salesforce describes them](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/).

### In Swayable Design System we rely on a [custom Tailwindcss theme](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme) for our design tokens, and strongly prefer Tailwindcss classes over custom CSS. This makes our design consistent and easily maintained across our systems.
