Principles are the foundation of the system. They form the basis of a good product and help the team with decision making. They are here to guide you and your team when working with the myriad parts of the system and help you do better and more informed decisions.

## Intuition even over explanation

Humans make intuitive evaluations much faster and easier than rational ones. Communicate accurately and effectively on an intuitive level.

## Let information flow into action

The next set of actions from any given place are natural or even inevitable. Make information actionable whenever possible to empower decision makers.

## Don’t bury the lede

Optimize the default setting so that the most important information is conveyed first. Always consider visual hierarchy and how it will change for different user needs.

## Transparency even over clarity

Acknowledge the noise, as this is inevitable. Better to be comprehensive than to omit in the name of simplicity. Don’t distract from the hard truths in the data.

## Accessible rocket science

Users can gain insight without a science background. Make users feel like experts. Don’t complicate things to make them look more impressive.
