We _strongly_ prefer utlity classes over custom CSS. It helps our designs stay consistent and easily maintained across systems.

You an use almost all [Tailwindcss utility classes](//tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first) in the Swayable Component Library. Some colors are unavailable because Swayable relies on a custom [Tailwindcss theme](//tailwindcss.com/docs/theme). See our [Design Tokens](/#/Design%20Tokens) for more information.
